## Guideline

### Before you start

Please take a look at the roadmap listed down [here](#Roadmap) before working on any issue or feature. The enhancements that I require for this project are listed here, sort of a _wishlist_. Also look at the list of open [issue(s)](https://github.com/maacpiash/technical-date/issues) that might need fixing. You might find find interest in one or two of them.

To work on a new issue or feature, please [email me](mailto:github@maacpiash.com) or [open an issue](https://github.com/maacpiash/technical-date/issues/new) before forking. It is recommended that you follow one of the templates described [here](https://github.com/maacpiash/technical-date/tree/trunk/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). After discussion, if the issue is deemed necessary to be addressed, we can start working on it.

To work on the issue, fork this repository as a project under your own GitHub username. You may want to create a new branch, properly named after the issue. This would help you if you would like to work on more issues down the road.

### Time to code

Please do not change the configuration of [EditorConfig](https://github.com/maacpiash/technical-date/tree/trunk/.editorconfig), [Prettier](https://github.com/maacpiash/technical-date/tree/trunk/.prettierrc.yaml), and [ESLint](https://github.com/maacpiash/technical-date/tree/trunk/.eslintrc.yaml). Follow the configurations. If you're using Visual Studio Code, the files would be properly formatted on save.

For commit messages, please follow [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) emoji guide. The emoji should follow a space and an imperative clause (i.e. 'Fix that bug' or 'Add new feature', instead of '_Fixed_ that bug' or 'New feature'). Commit your changes and push them to the branch you opened.

Create a new Pull Request when you're done. **Pull requests that do not follow these guidelines will not be accepted.**
